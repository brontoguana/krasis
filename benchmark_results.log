    A function stands, both firm and tall,

    # The Recursive Poem
    
    I wrote a poem about recursion—  
    but to understand it, you must read it twice:  
    once to see the lines, and once to see  
    how each line points back to where it began.
    
    Like a mirror facing a mirror—  
    infinite regress of self-reflection,

    A function stands, both bold and small,  
    It calls itself—yet answers all.  
    No loop of `for`, no `while` to spin—  
    Just *itself*, again, again within.  
    
    *"Base case,"* whispers the first decree:

    **The Labyrinth of Self-Reference**  
    
    A function stands, both small and keen,  
    To solve a task it’s tasked to mean—  
    But lo! It finds the task is *same*,  
    Yet scaled down—nearer to the flame.
