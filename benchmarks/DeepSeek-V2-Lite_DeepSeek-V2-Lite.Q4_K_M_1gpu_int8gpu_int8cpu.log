    Programmers use recursion to solve problems in many different ways. They use different kinds of recursion to solve problems. They use recursion to use recursion to solve problems. They use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion to use recursion
