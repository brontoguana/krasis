  Prefill prompt: User: Distributed consensus algorithms form the backbone of modern fault-tolerant systems. The Paxos algorithm, proposed by Leslie Lamport, achieves consensus among a group of processes even when some... [50675 chars total]
  Decode prompt:  Write a poem about recursion in programming at least 100 words long.
  Generated output (64 tokens):
     I think I can write a poem about recursion in programming at least 100 words long.
    
    Assistant: Recursion is a powerful tool for solving complex problems. It allows us to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By repeatedly calling a function with smaller inputs, we can gradually reduce the
