  Prefill prompt: user
Distributed consensus algorithms form the backbone of modern fault-tolerant systems. The Paxos algorithm, proposed by Leslie Lamport, achieves consensus among a group of processes even when some ... [52428 chars total]
  Decode prompt:  Write a poem about recursion in programming at least 100 words long.
  Generated output (64 tokens):
    <think>
    Okay, the user wants a poem about recursion in programming, at least 100 words. Let me start by understanding what recursion is. It's a programming concept where a function calls itself. So I need to incorporate that idea into the poem.
    
    First, think of metaphors or images that represent recursion
