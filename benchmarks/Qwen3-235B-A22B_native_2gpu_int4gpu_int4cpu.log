    <think>
    Okay, the user wants a poem about recursion in programming. Hmm, recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. I need to make sure the poem captures that essence. Let me think about the key elements of recursion.
    
    First, the structure of a recursive function: it has a base case and a
