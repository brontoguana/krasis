  Generated output (64 tokens):
    **The Recursive Ladder**  
    
    A function calls itself—soft and low,  
    A whisper in the code’s deep flow.  
    It stacks its steps on memory’s shelf,  
    A tower built to test itself.  
    
    *“Base case first!”* it softly cries—  
    A guard against the endless skies
